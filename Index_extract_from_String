#program to  print the ininal index of a character in a given string
# s='programming'
# index  of g 3

def index():
    s=input("enter your string:")
    b=input("extract the index of char:")
    for i in range (len(s)):
        print(s.index(b))
        break
index()


another  way to solve
def index():
      s=input("enter your string:")
      b=input("extract the index of  char:")
     if b in s:
          print("index of ",b,"is",s.index(b))
     else:
           print("index was not  found ")
index()
